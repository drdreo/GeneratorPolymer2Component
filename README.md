# ðŸ”§ GeneratorPolymer2Component
A polymer v2 component generator via yeoman-generator.

ðŸ”¥ [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/learning/) is a great, easy-to-use tool for creating own CLI generators.
 
Was created to ease the workflow of creating a webcomponent + style module using Polymer v2.
It's a command line tool with some prompts like: prefix, name, attributes, style module and automatically creates the files prefilled with the users input.

## ðŸ’¤ For Lazy
Comes in handy, when creating multiple components but don't want to copy, paste and edit strings over and over again.
